If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same

'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change

Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah-yeah
Though this feeling I can't change
But, please, don't take it so badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame

But, if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same

'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change
Lord, help me, I can't change

Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah
